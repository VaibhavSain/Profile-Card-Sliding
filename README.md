🚀 Project Alert: Automatic Profile Slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🎯

I just built an Automatic Profile Slider using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – no libraries, no frameworks!

🧩 Key Features:

    Smooth automatic sliding between profile cards

    Clean, modern UI design with responsive layout

    Customizable profile content (name, role, image, bio)

    Pause-on-hover and infinite loop functionality

    Built with vanilla JavaScript – great for learning and practicing DOM manipulation and CSS animations

📌 Tech Stack:

    HTML for structure

    CSS for layout, transitions, and styling

    JavaScript for functionality and timing control

🔍 Use Cases:

    Team/Staff section on a website

    Testimonials/Client feedback carousel

    Portfolio or personal branding sites

💡 Want to see it in action or integrate it into your own project? I’d be happy to share the code or collaborate!
